Vulnerability Assessment Report
------------------
System Description
------------------
The target of this vulnerability assessment is a Linux-based database server running the latest stable distribution. 
The system is equipped with a high-performance CPU and 128GB of RAM and hosts a MySQL database used for storing operational, customer, and business data. 
The server communicates with other internal systems over IPv4 and uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit.

Because this server operates as a critical datastore within the organization’s infrastructure, it plays a central role in business operations, decision-support processes,
and daily service delivery. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data is essential to maintaining customer trust, preventing operational disruption,
and supporting compliance requirements.

If this server were compromised or taken offline—whether through malicious activity or system failure—the business could experience data loss, service downtime, revenue impact, 
and reputational damage. For these reasons, securing this system is a priority for the cybersecurity team.
------------------
Scope
----------------
This vulnerability assessment focuses specifically on the access controls related to the database server. The review covers a three-month period from June 20XX to August 20XX.
NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1 was used as the guiding framework for conducting the risk assessment and evaluating threats, likelihood, impact, and residual risk.
----------------
Risk Assessment
-------------------
The table below summarizes identified risks associated with the system’s access controls. Likelihood and severity were ranked on a scale of 1–3, where 1 = low, 2 = medium, and 3 = high.

Risk Table
Threat Source	Threat Event	Likelihood	Severity	Risk (L × S)
External attacker	Exploitation of weak access controls to gain unauthorized access	3	- 3 -	9
Insider (malicious employee)	Unauthorized data access or privilege misuse	2 -	3	- 6
Malware / ransomware	Compromise of the server leading to data encryption or destruction	2 -	3	 -6
Misconfiguration	Incorrect permissions exposing sensitive data	2 -	2	 -4
Network outage or system failure	Server becomes unavailable, disrupting business operations	1	- 3	- 3
------------
Approach
------------
This assessment was conducted using a risk-based approach guided by NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. Risks were selected based on their relevance to access control weaknesses, the system’s role in 
storing sensitive business data, and known attack vectors frequently associated with database environments.

Likelihood scores were assigned by evaluating factors such as historical incidents, threat intelligence, known vulnerabilities, and the system’s exposure within the network. 
Severity scores were based on potential business impact, including data loss, operational downtime, legal ramifications, and reputational harm.

Limitations of this assessment include restricted visibility into other interconnected systems, limited log retention from previous months, and the absence of penetration testing due 
to scope boundaries. Despite these limitations, the findings provide a credible overview of the system’s risk posture and actionable guidance for strengthening access controls.
---------------------
Remediation Strategy
------------------------
Multiple technical, operational, and managerial controls can mitigate the risks identified in this assessment:

1. Strengthen Access Controls

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for database administrators.
Enforce strong password policies and rotate credentials regularly.
Limit remote access to the database server using IP allowlists and firewall rules.

2. Principle of Least Privilege

Review and reduce user permissions to ensure access aligns with job responsibilities.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within MySQL for granular permission management.

3. Patch and Configuration Management

Apply regular security updates to the Linux OS and MySQL server.
Conduct configuration baselines using tools like CIS Benchmarks.
Perform periodic reviews to identify misconfigurations or permission drift.

4. Logging and Monitoring Improvements

Enable enhanced audit logs within MySQL to track authentication attempts, privilege changes, and failed access attempts.
Forward logs to a SIEM platform to support threat detection and incident response.

5. Business Continuity & Backup Controls

Maintain encrypted, offsite database backups.
Test recovery plans regularly to ensure resilience against ransomware or system failures.
------------------
Assessment Impact
-----------------
Implementing these remediation steps will significantly strengthen the server’s security posture and reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access or service disruption. 
The recommendations improve the organization’s overall ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats while protecting critical data assets.
