Entry #: 1
-----------
Description
-----------
Documenting a cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access and ransomware deployment within a health care organization.
--------------------------
The 5 W’s of the Incident
--------------------------
Who:
An organized group of unethical hackers operating as a financially motivated threat actor.

What:
A ransomware attack that resulted in the encryption of critical systems and sensitive operational data.

Where:
A health care company with access to protected health information (PHI) and mission-critical medical systems.

When:
Tuesday at 9:00 a.m., during standard business operations.

Why:
Attackers gained access through a successful phishing campaign targeting employees.
After establishing initial access, they executed ransomware payloads across the network to encrypt essential files.
The ransom note left behind demanded a substantial payment in exchange for the decryption key, indicating financial motivation.

Additional Notes / Reflection
------------------------------
How could the health care company prevent an incident like this in the future?----

Implement stronger email security controls such as phishing filters, attachment sandboxing, and domain reputation checks.
Require mandatory employee cybersecurity awareness training, particularly focusing on phishing and social engineering.
Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to reduce the impact of compromised credentials.
Maintain regular, encrypted, offline backups to ensure system recovery without needing to negotiate with attackers.
Invest in endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools capable of detecting lateral movement and ransomware behaviors.
Apply network segmentation to prevent widespread file encryption if one endpoint is compromised.

Should the company pay the ransom?----

Paying the ransom is strongly discouraged for several reasons: 
There is no guarantee the attackers will provide a working decryption key.
Paying incentivizes and funds future criminal activity.
Payment may violate regulations depending on the attackers’ identities or sanctioned status.
Well-maintained backups and recovery plans are the safer and more ethical mitigation path.

Most cybersecurity guidelines—including those from CISA, FBI, and NIST—recommend not paying the ransom and instead focusing on incident response, recovery, and long-term hardening.
