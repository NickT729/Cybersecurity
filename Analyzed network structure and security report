Security Risk Assessment Report


Part 1: Hardening Tools and Methods
To strengthen the organization’s security and reduce system vulnerabilities, three recommended hardening methods are:
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Create and Enforce Strong Password Policies
Perform Regular Firewall Reviews and Maintenance

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA adds an extra step to the login process by requiring users to confirm their identity in more than one way. 
For example, a user might enter a password and then verify with a fingerprint scan, a one-time code sent to their phone, or an access card. 
This makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen credentials alone.

Password Policies
Password policies help ensure that all employees use secure and unique passwords. The policy can define password length, allowed characters, and rules about reusing old passwords. 
It can also set limits on failed login attempts—such as locking an account after five unsuccessful tries—to prevent brute-force attacks.
Employees should also be reminded not to share passwords under any circumstances.

Firewall Maintenance
Keeping the firewall up to date is essential for protecting the company’s internal network. Regular maintenance should include reviewing firewall rules, checking for outdated configurations, 
and updating settings to block suspicious traffic. This ongoing process helps detect and stop threats before they cause harm.


Part 2: Recommendations and Justifications

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA provides a strong defense against unauthorized access by requiring multiple forms of verification. Even if a hacker manages to steal a password, they still won’t be able to log in
without the second verification step. This significantly reduces the success rate of phishing and brute-force attacks. MFA also discourages employees from sharing passwords, since a
password alone wouldn’t grant someone full access.

2. Strong Password Policy
Implementing and enforcing a clear password policy increases overall network security. Complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols make it more difficult for 
attackers to guess or crack them. Requiring regular password changes and preventing password reuse further reduces the risk of compromise. Additionally, automatic account lockouts after
repeated failed login attempts can stop brute-force attempts early.

3. Regular Firewall Maintenance
A properly maintained firewall acts as the first line of defense against external threats. Administrators should routinely review and update firewall rules to match the latest security 
standards and organizational needs. Any suspicious IP addresses or unusual traffic patterns should be blocked immediately. After any security event or attempted intrusion, firewall 
configurations should be reassessed to close any new vulnerabilities. These updates help the company defend against threats like denial-of-service (DoS) and 
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Summary:
By combining MFA, strong password enforcement, and consistent firewall maintenance, the organization can significantly improve its security posture. 
These controls work together to protect sensitive data, reduce unauthorized access, and help the company stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
