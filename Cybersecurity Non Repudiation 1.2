Sign a contract:
Signature adds non-repudiation 
Others can see signature 

Adds a different perspective for cryptography:  
Proof of integrity 
Proof or origin 

Proof of integrity:
Verify data does not change 
Data remains accurate and consistent 
In cryptography, we use a hash 
Represents data as a short string of text 
A message digest, or fingerprint 
Doesn't necessarily associate data with an individual  
Only tells you if the data has changed 

Proof of Origin: 
Prove the message was not changed 
Integrity 
Prove the source of the message 
Authentication 
Make sure the signature isn't fake 
Non-repudiation 

Sign with the private key 
Message doesn't need to be encrypted 
None else can sign this (obviously) 

Verify with the public key 
Any change to the message will invalidate the signature
