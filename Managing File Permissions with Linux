Part 1: Security Controls I Worked On

1. Setting User Permissions (Least Privilege)
I found that everyone in the company could view customer files, which isn’t safe. I used Linux commands to make sure only specific users could access sensitive folders.
# Create a new group for IT admins
sudo groupadd it_admin

# Add the admin user to that group
sudo usermod -aG it_admin admin1

# Change file ownership so only IT admins can access it
sudo chown root:it_admin /etc/customer_data

# Set permissions so only the owner and IT group can read/write
sudo chmod 770 /etc/customer_data

Result:
Now only the admin and IT team can open customer data folders. Regular employees are blocked automatically.

2. Creating Strong Password Rules

User passwords were too short and easy to guess. I updated the password policy and added a rule that locks the account after too many failed login attempts.
# Open password settings file
sudo nano /etc/login.defs

# Example settings I added or edited
PASS_MIN_LEN 10
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90

To stop brute-force logins:
# Edit PAM authentication rules
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth
# Add this line:
auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 unlock_time=600

Result:
Passwords must now be at least 10 characters long and accounts lock for 10 minutes after 5 failed login tries.

3. Adding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
To make logins safer, I set up MFA so users need both a password and a code from their phone to log in.

# Install Google Authenticator tool
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator

# Enable MFA in SSH settings
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Add this line:
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so


Then I edited the SSH configuration:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Make sure this line is set to "yes"
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

# Restart SSH to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart ssh

Result:
Now every remote login requires both a password and a verification code, which helps stop stolen password attacks.

4. Checking and Updating Firewall Rules
The system firewall was on, but some rules were missing or outdated. I cleaned it up and made sure only important traffic was allowed.

# Turn on the firewall and check its status
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status

# Block all incoming traffic by default
sudo ufw default deny incoming

# Allow only necessary connections
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # SSH
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp  # HTTPS

# Deny anything suspicious
sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.0/24

Result:
The firewall now only allows trusted traffic, blocking unknown IPs and unused ports.
5. Managing File Permissions and Ownership

I checked who could access sensitive folders and changed permissions to protect them.

# See current permissions
ls -l /home/shared/

# Change folder ownership
sudo chown admin1:it_admin /home/shared/

# Update permissions so only admins can access
sudo chmod 750 /home/shared/

Result:
Now only admin users can open or edit files in that directory. Others get a “Permission denied” message.

6. Backups and Recovery
To make sure files aren’t lost, I created a simple backup script that copies important folders once a day.
# Create a backup folder
sudo mkdir /backups

# Copy important files
sudo cp -r /etc/customer_data /backups/

# Schedule daily backup using cron
crontab -e
# Example cron line:
0 2 * * * cp -r /etc/customer_data /backups/

Result:
Backups run automatically every night at 2 AM, helping protect data in case of an incident.

Part 2: Why These Steps Matter
Security Control-	Purpose	How It Helps

Least Privilege-	Limits access to sensitive files	Reduces risk of insider threats or data leaks

Strong Passwords-	Enforces good password habits	Prevents brute-force and weak password attacks

MFA	Adds a second- login step	Protects against stolen passwords

Firewall Rules-	Blocks bad network traffic	Stops intrusions and DDoS attempts

File Permissions-	Controls who can read/write files	Keeps important data private

Backups	Keeps- copies of important files	Helps recovery after a cyberattack or hardware failure

Conclusion
By using simple Linux commands, I was able to improve security on the system and reduce risks.
These changes help protect company data, limit user access, and create a more secure and stable environment.
