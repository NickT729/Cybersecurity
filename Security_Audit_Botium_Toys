Security Audit – Botium Toys
Controls Assessment Checklist

Control	In Place (Yes/No)	Explanation

Least Privilege	❌	Right now, everyone in the company can access customer data. We should limit access so only employees who need this information can see it. 
This will reduce the chance of a data leak or misuse.

Disaster Recovery Plan	❌	There’s no backup plan if a major system failure or cyberattack happens. We need a recovery plan so the business can keep running if something goes wrong.

Password Policies	❌	Employee passwords are too simple. Stronger password rules (longer passwords, special characters, regular updates) are needed to help protect company systems.

Separation of Duties	❌	One person (the CEO) handles too many critical tasks, like running daily operations and managing payroll. Dividing these roles would lower the risk of 
mistakes or fraud.

Firewall	✅	The company has a working firewall that filters network traffic based on security rules. This helps block unwanted or suspicious activity.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS)	❌	There’s no system that monitors for possible hacking attempts. Installing an IDS would alert IT staff if someone tries to break in.

Backups	❌	Important data isn’t being backed up. Setting up regular backups would help the company recover faster after a breach or system failure.

Antivirus Software	✅	Antivirus software is installed and regularly updated by IT staff to keep systems protected from malware.

Legacy System Maintenance	❌	The company still uses older systems, but they aren’t checked or maintained on a regular schedule. Regular updates and a clear maintenance
plan would help reduce risks.

Encryption	❌	Data isn’t currently encrypted. Using encryption would help protect sensitive information like customer and payment data.

Password Management System	❌	There’s no password manager in use. Implementing one would make it easier for employees to use strong, unique passwords safely.

Locks (Physical Security)	✅	Offices, the storefront, and the warehouse have secure locks in place.

CCTV Surveillance	✅	Cameras are installed and working to monitor physical spaces.

Fire Detection/Prevention Systems	✅	Fire alarms and sprinklers are working properly to protect people and property.

Compliance Checklist
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
Best Practice	In Place (Yes/No)	Explanation
Only authorized users have access to customers’ credit card data.	❌	Everyone in the company can see customer payment info. Access should be limited to specific, authorized employees.

Credit card data is stored securely.	❌	Payment info isn’t encrypted, and too many people can access it. This makes it vulnerable.

Use encryption for payment data.	❌	Encryption should be added to protect credit card transactions.

Use strong password management policies.	❌	Passwords aren’t strong or well-managed. A password manager would help enforce better security.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Best Practice	In Place (Yes/No)	Explanation
Protect EU customers’ personal data.	❌	Customer data isn’t encrypted, so it’s not fully secure.

Notify EU customers of breaches within 72 hours.	✅	There is a plan in place to alert customers within 72 hours if their data is compromised.

Classify and organize all company data.	❌	Assets are listed but not labeled or categorized properly.

Enforce privacy policies and procedures.	✅	Privacy rules exist and are followed by IT and staff where needed.

System and Organization Controls (SOC 1 / SOC 2)
Best Practice	In Place (Yes/No)	Explanation
Set user access policies.	❌	No access controls are in place, so all employees can see sensitive data.

Keep personal/sensitive data private.	❌	Data isn’t encrypted, which puts personal information at risk.

Maintain data integrity.	✅	Data is consistent and accurate.

Limit data access to authorized users only.	❌	All employees currently have access; permissions should be restricted based on job role.

Recommendations
To improve security, Botium Toys should:

Limit employee access (Least Privilege)

Create a disaster recovery plan

Enforce strong password policies

Set up an IDS system to detect intrusions

Implement regular backups and legacy system maintenance

Use encryption for customer and payment data

Introduce a password manager to simplify secure access

Properly classify and label assets to find security gaps faster

These changes would help protect sensitive data, strengthen compliance, and lower the company’s risk of data breaches or operational downtime.
