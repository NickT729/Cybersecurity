CIA Triad: 

Combination of principles 

 

Confidentiality: 
Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems 
Certain information should only be known to certain people 
Prevent Unauthorized  information disclosure 

Encryption: 
Encode messages so only certain people can read it 

Access Controls: 
Selectively restrict access to a resource 

Two-Factor Authentication: 
Additional Confirmation before information is disclosed 

Integrity: 
Messages can't be modified without detection 
Data is stored and transferred as intended 
Any modification to the data would be identified 

Hashing: 
Map data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length  
Person sending will create a hash of the data, sending both data and hash at once, when receiving, if your hash matches the sender's hash, it's same as sent 

Digital Signature: 
Mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data  
Takes hash and encrypts it with an asymmetric encryption algorithm  

  

Certificates: 
Combine with a digital signature to verify an individual   

Non-Repudiation: 
Provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine 

Availability: 
Systems and networks must be up and running 
Information is accessible to authorized users 
Always at your fingertips 

Redundancy: 
Build services that will always be available 

Fault tolerance: 
System will continue to run, even when a failure occurs.   

Patching: 
Stability 
Close Security Holes
