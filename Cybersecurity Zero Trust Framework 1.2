Zero Trust: 
Holistic approach to network security 
Covers every device, every process, every person 
Everything must be verified 
Nothing is inherently trusted 
MFA authentication, encryption, systems permissions, additional firewalls, monitoring and analytics, etc.  

Planes of operation: 
Split the network into functional planes 
Applies to physical, virtual, and cloud components 

Data plane: 
Process the frames, packets, and network data 
Processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT 

Implicit Trust Zones: 
Some zones are implicitly trusted for networks 
Example, trusted to internal zone traffic  

Policy Enforcement Point: 
Subjects and systems 
End users, applications, and non-human entities 
All traffic in network must pass through Policy enforcement point to allow or disallow 
Allow, monitor, and terminate connections 

Control Plane: 
Manages the actions of the data plane 
Defines policies and procedures 
Determines how packets should be forwarded 
Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables 

Adaptive Identity: 
Consider the source and the requested resources 
Multiple risk indicators – relationship to the org, physical location, type of connection, IP address, etc 
Makes the authentication stronger, if needed 

Threat Scope reduction: 
Decrease the number of possible entry points 

Policy-Driven Access Control: 
Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules 

Policy Administrator: 
Communicates with the policy enforcement point 
Generates access tokens or credentials 

Tells the PEP to allow access or note
