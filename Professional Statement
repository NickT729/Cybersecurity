Professional Cybersecurity Portfolio Statement

I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst and Automation Developer with a strong foundation in threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and Python-based security scripting.
My background in Management Information Systems and hands-on experience with LLM-driven exploit research, database security, and AI integration have equipped me to bridge 
the gap between data intelligence and system defense.

This repository highlights my journey in cybersecurity — from network monitoring dashboards and regex-based vulnerability scanners to tutorials and educational content aimed 
at helping others learn secure coding practices. I’m passionate about leveraging automation, open-source tools, and AI-assisted methodologies to build smarter, more resilient 
security solutions.
